    "- The `ParallelAgent` is a workflow agent that executes its sub-agents _concurrently_. This dramatically speeds up workflows where tasks can be performed independently.\n",
    "- Use `ParallelAgent` when: For scenarios prioritizing speed and involving independent, resource-intensive tasks, a `ParallelAgent` facilitates efficient parallel execution. **When sub-agents operate without dependencies, their tasks can be performed cocurrently, significantly reducing overall processing time.\n",
    "- As with other workflow agents, the `ParallelAgent` is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are only concerned with their execution (i.e. executing sub-agents in parallel), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs."
