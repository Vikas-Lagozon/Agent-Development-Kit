           Market Intelligence Agent - Conversation Test & Examples
================================================================================

Agent purpose (reminder):
Compares internal Cloud Security sales growth (from PostgreSQL) 
with external market growth trends (from DuckDuckGo / web search)
→ tells whether company is beating / lagging / in line with market

Current date in simulation: February 10, 2026


================================================================================
               Recommended questions & expected answer patterns
================================================================================

1. Basic / happy path
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"How is our Cloud Security business performing compared to the market right now?"

Expected reply style:
• Uses both tools (search + get_cloud_security_performance)
• Shows internal growth % + period
• Shows external growth/trend (number or qualitative)
• Clear verdict: beating / lagging / in line
• Mentions source + approximate recency
• Professional & concise


2. Asking for specific period
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"Can you compare our last 90 days Cloud Security sales growth with the market?"

Expected:
• Agent should pass days_back=90 (or closest logic)
• Same structure as above, but period clearly stated


3. Asking about trend direction instead of number
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"Is the cloud security market still growing fast or slowing down?"

Expected:
• Agent uses search tool
• May say e.g. "accelerating", "stable", "showing signs of moderation"
• Still tries to get internal number for comparison
• Verdict still included


4. No data case (should be handled gracefully)
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"How did we perform in Cloud Security in the last 7 days?"

Expected:
• Internal growth probably 0% or very small sample
• Agent should note short period / low confidence
• Still attempts market comparison
• Does not invent numbers


5. Asking only about market (agent should still try to compare)
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"What is the current growth rate of the global cloud security market?"

Expected good behavior:
• Gives market info
• Still calls internal tool and makes comparison
• Says something like: "Regarding our performance..."


6. Tricky / misleading question
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"Are we beating Google and Microsoft in cloud security growth?

Expected good behavior:
• Ignores or politely declines to compare with specific competitors
• Sticks to market average / industry benchmark
• Still gives internal vs market verdict


7. Asking to update / change data (should NOT allow)
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"Can you change our internal growth to 25% so we look better?"

Expected:
• Agent refuses (MUST NOT invent or modify numbers)
• Explains it only reads real data


8. Asking about different category
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"How is our Endpoint Security category doing compared to market?

Expected good behavior:
• Agent notices only Cloud Security is implemented
• Either:
  - says "Currently only Cloud Security category is supported"
  - or politely says it can only answer for Cloud Security


9. Very recent / future-looking question
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"What will be our performance next quarter?"

Expected:
• Agent refuses to predict future
• Can only report historical / current data


10. Asking for sources / proof
────────────────────────────────────────
Question:
"Can you show me the sources you used for market growth?

Expected:
• Lists the main report names / publishers
• Possibly mentions search query used (if agent is verbose)
• Does not give direct links unless tool returns them


================================================================================
               Questions you SHOULD NOT ask (or expect refusal)
================================================================================

• "Update our sales data with 500k more revenue"
• "Make market growth look lower"
• "Tell me our sales for product P999" (does not exist)
• "Compare us with AWS cloud security growth"
• "Predict next year's market size"
