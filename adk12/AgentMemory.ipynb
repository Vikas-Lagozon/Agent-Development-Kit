      "\n",
      "### 1. Creative & Art Supplies\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Washable Art Supplies:** Think chunky crayons, large paper, washable markers, paint sticks (less messy than traditional paint), or even a set of finger paints. An easel can also be a big hit!\n",
      "*   **Play-Doh or Kinetic Sand:** These are fantastic for sensory play, fine motor skills, and creative expression. Look for sets with fun tools and molds.\n",
      "*   **Sticker Books or Dot Markers:** Great for creativity and fine motor development without a huge mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Imaginative & Pretend Play\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dress-Up Clothes:** Princess dresses, superhero capes, doctor kits, chef outfits, or animal costumes can spark endless role-playing fun.\n",
      "*   **Play Kitchen & Food:** If she doesn't have one, a play kitchen with a set of realistic-looking play food (wooden or plastic) and a tea set is a classic for a reason.\n",
      "*   **Dolls & Accessories:** A baby doll with a stroller, high chair, or extra outfits can encourage nurturing play.\n",
      "*   **Puppets:** Simple hand puppets can inspire storytelling and imaginative scenarios.\n",
      "*   **Figurines & Small World Play:** Animal sets (farm, zoo, forest) or small character figures can be used for building little scenes and stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Building & Construction\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **LEGO DUPLO Sets:** These larger blocks are perfect for small hands and come in a huge variety of themes (animals, vehicles, houses).\n",
      "*   **Magnetic Tiles (e.g., Magna-Tiles, Connetix):** These are incredibly popular for a reason! They encourage creativity, spatial reasoning, and engineering skills.\n",
      "*   **Large Wooden Blocks:** Simple, open-ended, and durable for building all sorts of structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Books\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Picture Books:** Look for engaging stories with colorful illustrations. Favorites often include lift-the-flap books, rhyming books, or stories about animals or everyday experiences.\n",
      "*   **Interactive Books:** Books with textures, sounds, or things to push and pull can be very engaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Active & Outdoor Play\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Tricycle or Balance Bike:** Great for developing gross motor skills and getting outside.\n",
      "*   **Bubble Machine:** Simple joy, always a winner!\n",
      "*   **Outdoor Ball Set:** A soft soccer ball, kickball, or small basketball.\n",
      "*   **Sand & Water Table (if they have outdoor space):** Provides hours of sensory fun, especially with a few scoops, molds, and small toys.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Educational & Cognitive\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chunky Wooden Puzzles:** Puzzles with 4-12 large pieces are perfect for this age.\n",
      "*   **Shape Sorters or Stacking Toys:** Helps with problem-solving and recognizing shapes and sizes.\n",
      "*   **Simple Board Games:** Look for games specifically designed for preschoolers that focus on color matching, simple counting, or cooperation.\n",

      "### Tips for Choosing:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Consider her existing toys:** Does she have a lot of one type already?\n",
      "*   **Check with the parents:** They might have a specific wish list or preferences (e.g., avoiding noisy toys, too many stuffed animals).\n",
      "*   **Focus on open-ended play:** Toys that can be played with in many different ways tend to have longer-lasting appeal.\n",
      "*   **Safety first:** Ensure any toy is non-toxic and free of small parts that could be a choking hazard.\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter what you choose, the thought and care will surely make her birthday special!\n",
      "Agent Response:  That's a fantastic idea! A bike is a wonderful gift that encourages outdoor play, gross motor skills, and independence. For a three-year-old, there are two excellent age-appropriate options:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Balance Bikes (Highly Recommended)\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What they are:** Balance bikes are bikes without pedals. Children sit on the seat and propel themselves forward by pushing off the ground with their feet.\n",
      "*   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:**\n",
      "    *   **Teaches Balance:** This is their biggest advantage! Children learn to balance and steer naturally, which is the hardest part of learning to ride a traditional pedal bike.\n",
      "    *   **Easier Transition:** Kids who master a balance bike often skip training wheels entirely and transition directly to a pedal bike with much less difficulty, sometimes even as early as age 4 or 5.\n",
      "    *   **Builds Confidence:** They feel in control because their feet are always on the ground.\n",
      "    *   **Active & Fun:** They can go surprisingly fast and navigate different terrains.\n",
      "*   **What to look for:**\n",
      "    *   **Lightweight:** Easier for a child to maneuver and pick up if they fall.\n",
      "    *   **Adjustable Seat Height:** Crucial! Make sure her feet can rest flat on the ground with a slight bend in the knee when seated. This allows her to push off properly.\n",
      "    *   **Footrest (Optional but nice):** Some balance bikes have a built-in footrest so kids can practice gliding with their feet up.\n",
      "    *   **No brakes needed initially:** While some have hand brakes, at age 3, they primarily use their feet to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "    **Popular Brands:** Strider, Woom, Joovy Bicycoo, Critical Cycles, Retrospec.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Tricycles\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What they are:** Three-wheeled bikes with pedals, offering stability.\n",
      "*   **Why they're good for 3-year-olds:**\n",
      "    *   **Stability:** The three wheels mean they won't tip over, which can be reassuring for some children (and parents!).\n",
      "    *   **Introduces Pedaling:** If she's ready, a tricycle can introduce the concept of pedaling and using her feet to move forward.\n",
      "    *   **Parent Push Handles:** Many tricycles designed for this age come with a handle for parents to push and steer, which is great for walks when little legs get tired or before they've fully mastered pedaling. Some can even convert from a stroller-like pusher to an independent trike.\n",
      "*   **What to look for:**\n",
      "    *   **Sturdy Construction:** Durability is key.\n",
      "    *   **Appropriate Size:** Make sure her feet can reach the pedals comfortably and push them without straining.\n",
      "    *   **Convertible Options:** Some tricycles grow with the child, offering different stages from parent-controlled to independent pedaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "    **Popular Brands:** Radio Flyer, Joovy Tricycoo, Schwinn, Little Tikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Which one to choose?\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **For learning pure balance and an easier transition to a two-wheeler later:** A **balance bike** is generally the superior choice.\n",
      "*   **For immediate stability, introducing pedaling, or if you prefer a parent-push option:** A **tricycle** is a great choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note for Both:**\n",
      "No matter which option you choose, a **helmet is absolutely essential!** Make sure to also include an age-appropriate, well-fitting helmet with the gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might want to chat with her parents if you can. They might have a preference or know if she's already shown interest in one over the other, or if they prefer to skip training wheels when she's older.\n"

       "   \n",
       "   ### 1. Creative & Art Supplies\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **Washable Art Supplies:** Think chunky crayons, large paper, washable markers, paint sticks (less messy than traditional paint), or even a set of finger paints. An easel can also be a big hit!\n",
       "   *   **Play-Doh or Kinetic Sand:** These are fantastic for sensory play, fine motor skills, and creative expression. Look for sets with fun tools and molds.\n",
       "   *   **Sticker Books or Dot Markers:** Great for creativity and fine motor development without a huge mess.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   ### 2. Imaginative & Pretend Play\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **Dress-Up Clothes:** Princess dresses, superhero capes, doctor kits, chef outfits, or animal costumes can spark endless role-playing fun.\n",
       "   *   **Play Kitchen & Food:** If she doesn't have one, a play kitchen with a set of realistic-looking play food (wooden or plastic) and a tea set is a classic for a reason.\n",
       "   *   **Dolls & Accessories:** A baby doll with a stroller, high chair, or extra outfits can encourage nurturing play.\n",
       "   *   **Puppets:** Simple hand puppets can inspire storytelling and imaginative scenarios.\n",
       "   *   **Figurines & Small World Play:** Animal sets (farm, zoo, forest) or small character figures can be used for building little scenes and stories.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   ### 3. Building & Construction\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **LEGO DUPLO Sets:** These larger blocks are perfect for small hands and come in a huge variety of themes (animals, vehicles, houses).\n",
       "   *   **Magnetic Tiles (e.g., Magna-Tiles, Connetix):** These are incredibly popular for a reason! They encourage creativity, spatial reasoning, and engineering skills.\n",
       "   *   **Large Wooden Blocks:** Simple, open-ended, and durable for building all sorts of structures.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   ### 4. Books\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **Picture Books:** Look for engaging stories with colorful illustrations. Favorites often include lift-the-flap books, rhyming books, or stories about animals or everyday experiences.\n",
       "   *   **Interactive Books:** Books with textures, sounds, or things to push and pull can be very engaging.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   ### 5. Active & Outdoor Play\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **Tricycle or Balance Bike:** Great for developing gross motor skills and getting outside.\n",
       "   *   **Bubble Machine:** Simple joy, always a winner!\n",
       "   *   **Outdoor Ball Set:** A soft soccer ball, kickball, or small basketball.\n",
       "   *   **Sand & Water Table (if they have outdoor space):** Provides hours of sensory fun, especially with a few scoops, molds, and small toys.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   ### 6. Educational & Cognitive\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **Chunky Wooden Puzzles:** Puzzles with 4-12 large pieces are perfect for this age.\n",
       "   *   **Shape Sorters or Stacking Toys:** Helps with problem-solving and recognizing shapes and sizes.\n",
       "   *   **Simple Board Games:** Look for games specifically designed for preschoolers that focus on color matching, simple counting, or cooperation.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   ### Tips for Choosing:\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **Consider her existing toys:** Does she have a lot of one type already?\n",
       "   *   **Check with the parents:** They might have a specific wish list or preferences (e.g., avoiding noisy toys, too many stuffed animals).\n",
       "   *   **Focus on open-ended play:** Toys that can be played with in many different ways tend to have longer-lasting appeal.\n",
       "   *   **Safety first:** Ensure any toy is non-toxic and free of small parts that could be a choking hazard.\n",

       "   \n",
       "   ### 1. Balance Bikes (Highly Recommended)\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **What they are:** Balance bikes are bikes without pedals. Children sit on the seat and propel themselves forward by pushing off the ground with their feet.\n",
       "   *   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:**\n",
       "       *   **Teaches Balance:** This is their biggest advantage! Children learn to balance and steer naturally, which is the hardest part of learning to ride a traditional pedal bike.\n",
       "       *   **Easier Transition:** Kids who master a balance bike often skip training wheels entirely and transition directly to a pedal bike with much less difficulty, sometimes even as early as age 4 or 5.\n",
       "       *   **Builds Confidence:** They feel in control because their feet are always on the ground.\n",
       "       *   **Active & Fun:** They can go surprisingly fast and navigate different terrains.\n",
       "   *   **What to look for:**\n",
       "       *   **Lightweight:** Easier for a child to maneuver and pick up if they fall.\n",
       "       *   **Adjustable Seat Height:** Crucial! Make sure her feet can rest flat on the ground with a slight bend in the knee when seated. This allows her to push off properly.\n",
       "       *   **Footrest (Optional but nice):** Some balance bikes have a built-in footrest so kids can practice gliding with their feet up.\n",
       "       *   **No brakes needed initially:** While some have hand brakes, at age 3, they primarily use their feet to stop.\n",
       "   \n",
       "       **Popular Brands:** Strider, Woom, Joovy Bicycoo, Critical Cycles, Retrospec.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   ### 2. Tricycles\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **What they are:** Three-wheeled bikes with pedals, offering stability.\n",
       "   *   **Why they're good for 3-year-olds:**\n",
       "       *   **Stability:** The three wheels mean they won't tip over, which can be reassuring for some children (and parents!).\n",
       "       *   **Introduces Pedaling:** If she's ready, a tricycle can introduce the concept of pedaling and using her feet to move forward.\n",
       "       *   **Parent Push Handles:** Many tricycles designed for this age come with a handle for parents to push and steer, which is great for walks when little legs get tired or before they've fully mastered pedaling. Some can even convert from a stroller-like pusher to an independent trike.\n",
       "   *   **What to look for:**\n",
       "       *   **Sturdy Construction:** Durability is key.\n",
       "       *   **Appropriate Size:** Make sure her feet can reach the pedals comfortably and push them without straining.\n",
       "       *   **Convertible Options:** Some tricycles grow with the child, offering different stages from parent-controlled to independent pedaling.\n",
       "   \n",
       "       **Popular Brands:** Radio Flyer, Joovy Tricycoo, Schwinn, Little Tikes.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   ### Which one to choose?\n",
       "   \n",
       "   *   **For learning pure balance and an easier transition to a two-wheeler later:** A **balance bike** is generally the superior choice.\n",
       "   *   **For immediate stability, introducing pedaling, or if you prefer a parent-push option:** A **tricycle** is a great choice.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   **Important Note for Both:**\n",
       "   No matter which option you choose, a **helmet is absolutely essential!** Make sure to also include an age-appropriate, well-fitting helmet with the gift.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   You might want to chat with her parents if you can. They might have a preference or know if she's already shown interest in one over the other, or if they prefer to skip training wheels when she's older.\"\"\"\n",

       "      text=\"\"\"It's so fun shopping for a three-year-old! At this age, they are little sponges, developing rapidly, and love to explore, pretend, and create. Here are some recommendations, categorized for easy browsing:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Creative & Art Supplies\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Washable Art Supplies:** Think chunky crayons, large paper, washable markers, paint sticks (less messy than traditional paint), or even a set of finger paints. An easel can also be a big hit!\n",
       "*   **Play-Doh or Kinetic Sand:** These are fantastic for sensory play, fine motor skills, and creative expression. Look for sets with fun tools and molds.\n",
       "*   **Sticker Books or Dot Markers:** Great for creativity and fine motor development without a huge mess.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. Imaginative & Pretend Play\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Dress-Up Clothes:** Princess dresses, superhero capes, doctor kits, chef outfits, or animal costumes can spark endless role-playing fun.\n",
       "*   **Play Kitchen & Food:** If she doesn't have one, a play kitchen with a set of realistic-looking play food (wooden or plastic) and a tea set is a classic for a reason.\n",
       "*   **Dolls & Accessories:** A baby doll with a stroller, high chair, or extra outfits can encourage nurturing play.\n",
       "*   **Puppets:** Simple hand puppets can inspire storytelling and imaginative scenarios.\n",
       "*   **Figurines & Small World Play:** Animal sets (farm, zoo, forest) or small character figures can be used for building little scenes and stories.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. Building & Construction\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **LEGO DUPLO Sets:** These larger blocks are perfect for small hands and come in a huge variety of themes (animals, vehicles, houses).\n",
       "*   **Magnetic Tiles (e.g., Magna-Tiles, Connetix):** These are incredibly popular for a reason! They encourage creativity, spatial reasoning, and engineering skills.\n",
       "*   **Large Wooden Blocks:** Simple, open-ended, and durable for building all sorts of structures.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. Books\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Picture Books:** Look for engaging stories with colorful illustrations. Favorites often include lift-the-flap books, rhyming books, or stories about animals or everyday experiences.\n",
       "*   **Interactive Books:** Books with textures, sounds, or things to push and pull can be very engaging.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. Active & Outdoor Play\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Tricycle or Balance Bike:** Great for developing gross motor skills and getting outside.\n",
       "*   **Bubble Machine:** Simple joy, always a winner!\n",
       "*   **Outdoor Ball Set:** A soft soccer ball, kickball, or small basketball.\n",
       "*   **Sand & Water Table (if they have outdoor space):** Provides hours of sensory fun, especially with a few scoops, molds, and small toys.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. Educational & Cognitive\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Chunky Wooden Puzzles:** Puzzles with 4-12 large pieces are perfect for this age.\n",
       "*   **Shape Sorters or Stacking Toys:** Helps with problem-solving and recognizing shapes and sizes.\n",
       "*   **Simple Board Games:** Look for games specifically designed for preschoolers that focus on color matching, simple counting, or cooperation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Tips for Choosing:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Consider her existing toys:** Does she have a lot of one type already?\n",
       "*   **Check with the parents:** They might have a specific wish list or preferences (e.g., avoiding noisy toys, too many stuffed animals).\n",
       "*   **Focus on open-ended play:** Toys that can be played with in many different ways tend to have longer-lasting appeal.\n",
       "*   **Safety first:** Ensure any toy is non-toxic and free of small parts that could be a choking hazard.\n",

       "\n",
       "### 1. Balance Bikes (Highly Recommended)\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **What they are:** Balance bikes are bikes without pedals. Children sit on the seat and propel themselves forward by pushing off the ground with their feet.\n",
       "*   **Why they're great for 3-year-olds:**\n",
       "    *   **Teaches Balance:** This is their biggest advantage! Children learn to balance and steer naturally, which is the hardest part of learning to ride a traditional pedal bike.\n",
       "    *   **Easier Transition:** Kids who master a balance bike often skip training wheels entirely and transition directly to a pedal bike with much less difficulty, sometimes even as early as age 4 or 5.\n",
       "    *   **Builds Confidence:** They feel in control because their feet are always on the ground.\n",
       "    *   **Active & Fun:** They can go surprisingly fast and navigate different terrains.\n",
       "*   **What to look for:**\n",
       "    *   **Lightweight:** Easier for a child to maneuver and pick up if they fall.\n",
       "    *   **Adjustable Seat Height:** Crucial! Make sure her feet can rest flat on the ground with a slight bend in the knee when seated. This allows her to push off properly.\n",
       "    *   **Footrest (Optional but nice):** Some balance bikes have a built-in footrest so kids can practice gliding with their feet up.\n",
       "    *   **No brakes needed initially:** While some have hand brakes, at age 3, they primarily use their feet to stop.\n",
       "\n",
       "    **Popular Brands:** Strider, Woom, Joovy Bicycoo, Critical Cycles, Retrospec.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. Tricycles\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **What they are:** Three-wheeled bikes with pedals, offering stability.\n",
       "*   **Why they're good for 3-year-olds:**\n",
       "    *   **Stability:** The three wheels mean they won't tip over, which can be reassuring for some children (and parents!).\n",
       "    *   **Introduces Pedaling:** If she's ready, a tricycle can introduce the concept of pedaling and using her feet to move forward.\n",
       "    *   **Parent Push Handles:** Many tricycles designed for this age come with a handle for parents to push and steer, which is great for walks when little legs get tired or before they've fully mastered pedaling. Some can even convert from a stroller-like pusher to an independent trike.\n",
       "*   **What to look for:**\n",
       "    *   **Sturdy Construction:** Durability is key.\n",
       "    *   **Appropriate Size:** Make sure her feet can reach the pedals comfortably and push them without straining.\n",
       "    *   **Convertible Options:** Some tricycles grow with the child, offering different stages from parent-controlled to independent pedaling.\n",
       "\n",
       "    **Popular Brands:** Radio Flyer, Joovy Tricycoo, Schwinn, Little Tikes.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Which one to choose?\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **For learning pure balance and an easier transition to a two-wheeler later:** A **balance bike** is generally the superior choice.\n",
       "*   **For immediate stability, introducing pedaling, or if you prefer a parent-push option:** A **tricycle** is a great choice.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important Note for Both:**\n",
       "No matter which option you choose, a **helmet is absolutely essential!** Make sure to also include an age-appropriate, well-fitting helmet with the gift.\n",
       "\n",
       "You might want to chat with her parents if you can. They might have a preference or know if she's already shown interest in one over the other, or if they prefer to skip training wheels when she's older.\"\"\"\n",
