    "## Core Terminology Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| # | **ADK Term** | **LangChain Equivalent** | **What It Means in ADK** | **What It Means in LangChain** | **Important Differences** |\n",
    "|---|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| 1 | **Agent** | Agent | Core reasoning unit that uses an LLM + tools + memory to respond to user input. | LLM-powered reasoning entity that decides tool usage and produces responses. | ADK agents are tightly integrated with Google models + structured event system. LangChain agents are more flexible and provider-agnostic. |\n",
    "| 2 | **Runner** | AgentExecutor | Orchestrates execution of the agent. Handles tool calls, looping, event generation, and state updates. | Executes the agent loop (LLM → tool → LLM → final output). | ADK Runner is more event-driven and structured. LangChain AgentExecutor is more linear. |\n",
    "| 3 | **Events** | Chat History / Messages | Structured record of everything that happens (user input, model output, tool calls, tool results, system updates). | List of messages (`HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ToolMessage`). | ADK events are richer and more granular (not just chat — includes system & state events). |\n",
    "| 4 | **Session** | Thread | Logical conversation container. Holds events + state. Identified by `session_id`. | Thread or conversation context passed between invocations. | ADK sessions are persistent and tied to session services. LangChain threads depend on memory implementation. |\n",
    "| 5 | **State** | State | Structured data attached to a session (can store variables, structured memory, context). | Memory variables stored in chain or agent memory. | ADK state is first-class and explicitly versioned. LangChain state is more loosely managed. |\n",
    "| 6 | **InMemorySessionService** | Short-Term Memory (STM) / Checkpointer | Stores sessions in RAM. Lost when process stops. | Memory like `ConversationBufferMemory` stored in runtime. | ADK separates storage layer from agent clearly. |\n",
    "| 7 | **DatabaseSessionService** | Long-Term Memory (LTM) | Persists sessions + events to DB (SQLite/Postgres/etc). | Persistent memory using Redis, SQL, etc. | ADK provides official structured DB schema. LangChain leaves persistence more open-ended. |\n",
    "| 8 | **Service** | Memory Store / Persistence Layer | Backend that stores sessions (in-memory, DB, etc). | Memory backend or vector store. | ADK services are specifically session-oriented, not just embeddings. |\n",
    "| 9 | **Tool** | Tool | External function callable by the agent. Same concept in both frameworks. | External function callable by the agent. | Same concept in both frameworks. |\n",
    "| 10 | **MCPTool** | Tool Wrapper / Custom Tool | ADK supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools via stdio/HTTP. | LangChain does not natively support MCP but can wrap APIs. | ADK has native MCP support; LangChain requires custom wrappers. |\n",
    "| 11 | **Connection** (StdioConnection / HTTPConnection) | Tool Transport Layer | Defines how tools are connected (subprocess, HTTP, etc). | Not formalized in LangChain. | LangChain does not formalize transport this way. |\n",
    "| 12 | **Context** | Memory Context | Information passed into model for reasoning (events + state). | Context passed to LLM. | ADK separates `context_spec` clearly. |\n",
    "| 13 | **ContextSpec** | Prompt Template + Memory Config | Defines how session memory and state are injected into model. | Prompt templates with memory configuration. | ADK has explicit context specification. |\n",
    "| 14 | **Memory Bank** | Vector Store | Used in advanced ADK for retrieval-based memory. Similar to LangChain retrievers. | Vector store for retrieval. | Similar concepts for retrieval-based memory. |\n",
    "| 15 | **AgentEngine** | LLM + Agent Runtime | Lower-level runtime that executes agents. | Agent runtime system. | Lower-level execution layer. |\n",
    "| 16 | **Eval Set / Eval Results** | LangSmith / Evaluation Framework | ADK includes built-in evaluation support. | LangChain uses LangSmith for evaluation. | ADK has native evaluation; LangChain uses external tool. |\n",
    "| 17 | **Automatic Function Calling (AFC)** | OpenAI Function Calling / Tool Calling | ADK's automatic tool invocation mode. | Tool calling API. | Similar automatic tool execution. |\n",
    "| 18 | **App** | LangServe Deployment | ADK wraps agents into Apps for serving over HTTP. | Deployment via LangServe. | Different deployment approaches. |\n",
