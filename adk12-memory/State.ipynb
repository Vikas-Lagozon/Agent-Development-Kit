    "# State: The Session's Scratchpad\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported in ADKPython v0.1.0TypeScript v0.2.0Go v0.1.0Java v0.1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each `Session` (our conversation thread), the **`state`** attribute acts like the agent's dedicated scratchpad for that specific interaction. While `session.events` holds the full history, `session.state` is where the agent stores and updates dynamic details needed *during* the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is `session.state`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, `session.state` is a collection (dictionary or Map) holding key-value pairs. It's designed for information the agent needs to recall or track to make the current conversation effective:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personalize Interaction:** Remember user preferences mentioned earlier (e.g., `'user_preference_theme': 'dark'`).\n",
    "- **Track Task Progress:** Keep tabs on steps in a multi-turn process (e.g., `'booking_step': 'confirm_payment'`).\n",
    "- **Accumulate Information:** Build lists or summaries (e.g., `'shopping_cart_items': ['book', 'pen']`).\n",
    "- **Make Informed Decisions:** Store flags or values influencing the next response (e.g., `'user_is_authenticated': True`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of `State`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure: Serializable Key-Value Pairs**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Data is stored as `key: value`.\n",
    "   - **Keys:** Always strings (`str`). Use clear names (e.g., `'departure_city'`, `'user:language_preference'`).\n",
    "   - **Values:** Must be **serializable**. This means they can be easily saved and loaded by the `SessionService`. Stick to basic types in the specific languages (Python/Go/Java/TypeScript) like strings, numbers, booleans, and simple lists or dictionaries containing *only* these basic types. (See API documentation for precise details).\n",
    "   - **⚠️ Avoid Complex Objects:** **Do not store non-serializable objects** (custom class instances, functions, connections, etc.) directly in the state. Store simple identifiers if needed, and retrieve the complex object elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mutability: It Changes**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The contents of the `state` are expected to change as the conversation evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Persistence: Depends on `SessionService`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Whether state survives application restarts depends on your chosen service:\n",
    "   - `InMemorySessionService`: **Not Persistent.** State is lost on restart.\n",
    "   - `DatabaseSessionService` / `VertexAiSessionService`: **Persistent.** State is saved reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific parameters or method names for the primitives may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `session.state['current_intent'] = 'book_flight'` in Python,`context.State().Set(\"current_intent\", \"book_flight\")` in Go, `session.state().put(\"current_intent\", \"book_flight)` in Java, or `context.state.set(\"current_intent\", \"book_flight\")` in TypeScript). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organizing State with Prefixes: Scope Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefixes on state keys define their scope and persistence behavior, especially with persistent services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Prefix (Session State):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Scope:** Specific to the *current* session (`id`).\n",
    "  - **Persistence:** Only persists if the `SessionService` is persistent (`Database`, `VertexAI`).\n",
    "  - **Use Cases:** Tracking progress within the current task (e.g., `'current_booking_step'`), temporary flags for this interaction (e.g., `'needs_clarification'`).\n",
    "  - **Example:** `session.state['current_intent'] = 'book_flight'`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`user:` Prefix (User State):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Scope:** Tied to the `user_id`, shared across *all* sessions for that user (within the same `app_name`).\n",
    "  - **Persistence:** Persistent with `Database` or `VertexAI`. (Stored by `InMemory` but lost on restart).\n",
    "  - **Use Cases:** User preferences (e.g., `'user:theme'`), profile details (e.g., `'user:name'`).\n",
    "  - **Example:** `session.state['user:preferred_language'] = 'fr'`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`app:` Prefix (App State):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Scope:** Tied to the `app_name`, shared across *all* users and sessions for that application.\n",
    "  - **Persistence:** Persistent with `Database` or `VertexAI`. (Stored by `InMemory` but lost on restart).\n",
    "  - **Use Cases:** Global settings (e.g., `'app:api_endpoint'`), shared templates.\n",
    "  - **Example:** `session.state['app:global_discount_code'] = 'SAVE10'`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`temp:` Prefix (Temporary Invocation State):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Scope:** Specific to the current **invocation** (the entire process from an agent receiving user input to generating the final output for that input).\n",
    "  - **Persistence:** **Not Persistent.** Discarded after the invocation completes and does not carry over to the next one.\n",
    "  - **Use Cases:** Storing intermediate calculations, flags, or data passed between tool calls within a single invocation.\n",
    "  - **When Not to Use:** For information that must persist across different invocations, such as user preferences, conversation history summaries, or accumulated data.\n",
    "  - **Example:** `session.state['temp:raw_api_response'] = {...}`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-Agents and Invocation Context\n",
    "\n",
    "When a parent agent calls a sub-agent (e.g., using `SequentialAgent` or `ParallelAgent`), it passes its `InvocationContext` to the sub-agent. This means the entire chain of agent calls shares the same invocation ID and, therefore, the same `temp:` state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Agent Sees It:** Your agent code interacts with the *combined* state through the single `session.state` collection (dict/ Map). The `SessionService` handles fetching/merging state from the correct underlying storage based on prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Session State in Agent Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with `LlmAgent` instances, you can directly inject session state values into the agent's instruction string using a simple templating syntax. This allows you to create dynamic and context-aware instructions without relying solely on natural language directives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `{key}` Templating\n",
    "\n",
    "To inject a value from the session state, enclose the key of the desired state variable within curly braces: `{key}`. The framework will automatically replace this placeholder with the corresponding value from `session.state` before passing the instruction to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Existence: Ensure that the key you reference in the instruction string exists in the session.state. If the key is missing, the agent will throw an error. To use a key that may or may not be present, you can include a question mark (?) after the key (e.g. {topic?}).\n",
    "- Data Types: The value associated with the key should be a string or a type that can be easily converted to a string.\n",
    "- Escaping: If you need to use literal curly braces in your instruction (e.g., for JSON formatting), you'll need to escape them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bypassing State Injection with `InstructionProvider`\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you might want to use `{{` and `}}` literally in your instructions without triggering the state injection mechanism. For example, you might be writing instructions for an agent that helps with a templating language that uses the same syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you can provide a function to the `instruction` parameter instead of a string. This function is called an `InstructionProvider`. When you use an `InstructionProvider`, the ADK will not attempt to inject state, and your instruction string will be passed to the model as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `InstructionProvider` function receives a `ReadonlyContext` object, which you can use to access session state or other contextual information if you need to build the instruction dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Direct Injection**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clarity: Makes it explicit which parts of the instruction are dynamic and based on session state.\n",
    "- Reliability: Avoids relying on the LLM to correctly interpret natural language instructions to access state.\n",
    "- Maintainability: Simplifies instruction strings and reduces the risk of errors when updating state variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relation to Other State Access Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "This direct injection method is specific to LlmAgent instructions. Refer to the following section for more information on other state access methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How State is Updated: Recommended Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The Right Way to Modify State\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need to change the session state, the correct and safest method is to **directly modify the `state` object on the `Context`** provided to your function (e.g., `callback_context.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'`). This is considered \"direct state manipulation\" in the right way, as the framework automatically tracks these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is critically different from directly modifying the `state` on a `Session` object you retrieve from the `SessionService` (e.g., `my_session.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'`). **You should avoid this**, as it bypasses the ADK's event tracking and can lead to lost data. The \"Warning\" section at the end of this page has more details on this important distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "State should **always** be updated as part of adding an `Event` to the session history using `session_service.append_event()`. This ensures changes are tracked, persistence works correctly, and updates are thread-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The Easy Way: `output_key` (for Agent Text Responses)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest method for saving an agent's final text response directly into the state. When defining your `LlmAgent`, specify the `output_key`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, the `Runner` uses the `output_key` to create the necessary `EventActions` with a `state_delta` and calls `append_event`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The Standard Way: `EventActions.state_delta` (for Complex Updates)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For more complex scenarios (updating multiple keys, non-string values, specific scopes like `user:` or `app:`, or updates not tied directly to the agent's final text), you manually construct the `state_delta` within `EventActions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Via `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext` (Recommended for Callbacks and Tools)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying state within agent callbacks (e.g., `on_before_agent_call`, `on_after_agent_call`) or tool functions is best done using the `state` attribute of the `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext` provided to your function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `callback_context.state['my_key'] = my_value`\n",
    "- `tool_context.state['my_key'] = my_value`\n",
    "\n",
    "These context objects are specifically designed to manage state changes within their respective execution scopes. When you modify `context.state`, the ADK framework ensures that these changes are automatically captured and correctly routed into the `EventActions.state_delta` for the event being generated by the callback or tool. This delta is then processed by the `SessionService` when the event is appended, ensuring proper persistence and tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method abstracts away the manual creation of `EventActions` and `state_delta` for most common state update scenarios within callbacks and tools, making your code cleaner and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more comprehensive details on context objects, refer to the [Context documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/index.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What `append_event` Does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adds the `Event` to `session.events`.\n",
    "- Reads the `state_delta` from the event's `actions`.\n",
    "- Applies these changes to the state managed by the `SessionService`, correctly handling prefixes and persistence based on the service type.\n",
    "- Updates the session's `last_update_time`.\n",
    "- Ensures thread-safety for concurrent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ A Warning About Direct State Modification\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid directly modifying the `session.state` collection (dictionary/Map) on a `Session` object that was obtained directly from the `SessionService` (e.g., via `session_service.get_session()` or `session_service.create_session()`) *outside* of the managed lifecycle of an agent invocation (i.e., not through a `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext`). For example, code like `retrieved_session = await session_service.get_session(...); retrieved_session.state['key'] = value` is problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "State modifications *within* callbacks or tools using `CallbackContext.state` or `ToolContext.state` are the correct way to ensure changes are tracked, as these context objects handle the necessary integration with the event system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why direct modification (outside of contexts) is strongly discouraged:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bypasses Event History:** The change isn't recorded as an `Event`, losing auditability.\n",
    "1. **Breaks Persistence:** Changes made this way **will likely NOT be saved** by `DatabaseSessionService` or `VertexAiSessionService`. They rely on `append_event` to trigger saving.\n",
    "1. **Not Thread-Safe:** Can lead to race conditions and lost updates.\n",
    "1. **Ignores Timestamps/Logic:** Doesn't update `last_update_time` or trigger related event logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:** Stick to updating state via `output_key`, `EventActions.state_delta` (when manually creating events), or by modifying the `state` property of `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext` objects when within their respective scopes. These methods ensure reliable, trackable, and persistent state management. Use direct access to `session.state` (from a `SessionService`-retrieved session) only for *reading* state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for State Design Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimalism:** Store only essential, dynamic data.\n",
    "- **Serialization:** Use basic, serializable types.\n",
    "- **Descriptive Keys & Prefixes:** Use clear names and appropriate prefixes (`user:`, `app:`, `temp:`, or none).\n",
    "- **Shallow Structures:** Avoid deep nesting where possible.\n",
    "- **Standard Update Flow:** Rely on `append_event`.\n"
