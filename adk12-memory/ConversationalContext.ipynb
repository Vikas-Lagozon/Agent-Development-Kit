    "## **<font color=\"red\">Introduction to Conversational Context: Session, State, and Memory</font>**\n",
    "- Meaningful, multi-turn conversations require agents to understand context. Just like humans, they need to recall the conversation history: what's been said and done to maintain continuity and avoid repetition. The **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** provides structured ways to manage this context through `Session`, `State`, and `Memory`.\n",
    "### **Core Concepts**\n",
    "- Think of different instances of your conversations with the agent as distinct **conversation threads**, potentially drawing upon **long-term knowledge**.\n",
    "  1. `Session`: The Current Conversation Thread\n",
    "     - Represents a _single_, ongoing _interaction_ between a user and your agent system.\n",
    "     - Contains the chronological sequence of messages and actions taken by the agent (referred to `Events`) during that specific interaction.\n",
    "     - A `Session` can also hold temporary data (`State`) relevant only during this conversation.\n",
    "  2. `State` (`session.state`): Data within the Current Conversation\n",
    "     - Data stored within a specific `Session`.\n",
    "     - Used to manage information relevant only to the current, active conversation thread (e.g., items in a shopping cart during this chat, user preferences mentioned in this session).\n",
    "  3. `Memory`: Searchable, Cross-Session Information\n",
    "     - Represents a store of information that might span multiple past sessions or include external data sources.\n",
    "     - It acts as a knowledge base the agent can search to recall information or context beyond the immediate conversation.\n",
    "### **Managing Context: Services**\n",
    "ADK provides services to manage these concepts:\n",
    "1. `SessionService`: Manages the different conversation threads (`Session` objects)\n",
    "   - Handles the lifecycle: creating, retrieving, updating (appending `Events`, modifying `State`), and deleting individual `Session`.\n",
    "2. `MemoryService`: Manages the Long-Term Knowledge Store (`Memory`)\n",
    "   - Handles ingesting information (often from completed `Session`) into the long-term store.\n",
    "   - Provides methods to search this stored knowledge based on queries.\n",
    "- **Implementations:** ADK offers different implementations for both `SessionService` and `MemoryService`, allowing you to choose the storage backend that best fits your application's needs. Notably, **in-memory implementations** are provided for both services; these are designed specifically for **local testing and fast development**. It's important to remember that **all data stored using these in-memory options (sessions, state, or long-term knowledge) is lost when your application restarts**. For persistence and scalability beyond local testing, ADK also offers cloud-based and database service options."

    "## **<font color=\"red\">Session: Tracking Individual Conversations</font>**\n",
    "### **The `Session` Object**\n",
    "- When a user starts interacting with your agent, the `SessionService` creates a `Session` object (`google.adk.sessions.Session`). This object acts as the container holding everything related to that one specific chat thread. Here are its key properties:\n",
    "  - **Identification (`id`, `appName`, `userId`):** Unique labels for the conversation.\n",
    "  - `id`: A unique identifier for this specific conversation thread, essential for retrieving it later. A SessionService object can handle multiple `Session`. This field identifies which aprticualr session object are we referring to. For example, \"test_id_modification\".\n",
    "  - `app_name`: Identifies which agent application this conversation belongs to. For example, \"id_modifier_workflow\".\n",
    "  - `userId`: Links the conversation to a particualr user.\n",
    "- **History (`events`):** A chronological sequence of all interactions (Event objects – user messages, agent responses, tool actions) that have occurred within this specific thread.\n",
    "- **Session State (`state`):** A place to store temporary data relevant only to this specific, ongoing conversation. This acts as a scratchpad for the agent during the interaction. We will cover how to use and manage `state` in detail in the next section.\n",
    "- **Activity Tracking (`lastUpdateTime`):** A timeestamp indicating the last time an event occurred in this conversation thread.\n"

    "### **Managing Sessions with a SessionService**\n",
    "- As seen above, you don't typically create or manage Session objects directly. Instead, you use a SessionService. This service acts as the central manager responsible for the entire lifecycle of your conversation sessions.\n",
    "- Its core responsibilities include:\n",
    "  - **Starting New Conversations:** Creating fresh Session objects when a user begins an interaction.\n",
    "  - **Resuming Existing Conversations:** Retrieving a specific Session (using its ID) so the agent can continue where it left off.\n",
    "  - **Saving Progress:** Appending new interactions (Event objects) to a session's history. This is also the mechanism through which session state gets updated (more in the State section).\n",

    "- **Requires:**\n",
    "  - A Google Cloud project (pip install vertexai)\n",
    "  - A Google Cloud storage bucket that can be configured by this step.\n",
    "  - A Reasoning Engine resource name/ID that can setup following this tutorial.\n",
    "  - If you do not have a Google Cloud project and you want to try the VertexAiSessionService, see Vertex AI Express Mode.\n",
    "- **Best for:** Scalable production applications deployed on Google Cloud, especially when integrating with other Vertex AI features."
