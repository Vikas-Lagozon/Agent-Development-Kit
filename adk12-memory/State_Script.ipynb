    "- **Bypassing State Injection with `InstructionProvider`:**\n",
    "  - In some cases, you might want to use `{{ and }}` literally in your instructions without triggering the state injection mechanism. For example, you might be writing instructions for an agent that helps with a templating language that uses the same syntax.\n",
    "  - To achieve this, you can provide a function to the `instruction` parameter instead of a string. This function is called an `InstructionProvider`. When you use an InstructionProvider, the ADK will not attempt to inject state, and your instruction string will be passed to the model as-is.\n",
    "  - The `InstructionProvider` function receives a ReadonlyContext object, which you can use to access session state or other contextual information if you need to build the instruction dynamically."

    "- **The Right Way to Modify State:**\n",
    "  - When you need to change the session state, the correct and safest method is to *directly modify the `state` object on the** `Context` provided to your function (e.g., `callback_context.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'`). This is considered \"direct state manipulation\" in the right way, as the framework automatically tracks these changes.\n",
    "  - This is critically different from directly modifying the `state` on a `Session` object you retrieve from the `SessionService` (e.g., `my_session.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'`). *You should avoid this*, as it bypasses the ADK's event tracking and can lead to lost data. The \"Warning\" section at the end of this page has more details on this important distinction.\n",

      "Luna was a shadow cat, sleek and black, with eyes like chips of emerald. For months, she’d been a silent fixture around Mrs. Gable’s small cottage, observing the world with a cool, detached curiosity. She knew the best sunbeam on the porch, the softest patch of long grass by the rose bushes, and the exact time Mrs. Gable put out a fresh bowl of water near the birdbath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gable, a woman whose wrinkles held the stories of many years, never tried to rush Luna. She’d simply talk to her from a distance, her voice a soft murmur that never startled the cautious cat. \"Hello there, midnight kitty,\" she'd say, placing a small bowl of kibble on the porch steps before retreating. Luna would wait until the door clicked shut, then pad forward, her movements fluid and silent, to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their friendship began with this quiet ritual – a space shared, an offering made, and an acceptance given. Luna would gradually spend more time on the porch, first just outside the circle of light from the window, then closer, curled on the welcome mat, one ear occasionally twitching as Mrs. Gable pottered inside. She never allowed herself to be touched, though. Not yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "One particularly blustery autumn evening, rain lashed against the cottage windows. Luna, caught unprepared, huddled under the porch awning, shivering. The door creaked open, and Mrs. Gable stood there, a warm glow spilling from behind her. She didn’t reach out, didn’t even speak, just left the door ajar, a silent invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luna hesitated. The wind whipped past, cold and wet. The scent of warmth and something akin to safety drifted out. With a small, tentative step, then another, she crossed the threshold. She found herself on a soft rug before a crackling fireplace, a warmth she’d only dreamed of. Mrs. Gable simply sat in her armchair, a gentle smile on her face, letting Luna explore.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that night, Luna’s independence softened. She still enjoyed her solitary prowls, but she always returned to the cottage, to the gentle hand that now stroked her fur, to the lap that offered warmth and the steady rhythm of a beating heart. She discovered the profound comfort of a purr, a rumble that vibrated through her whole body, a language of contentment she shared freely with Mrs. Gable.\n",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon, Mrs. Gable was sitting quietly, staring out at the rain-streaked garden, a cloud of loneliness settling about her. Luna, sensing the shift in her human’s quiet energy, didn't demand attention. Instead, she hopped onto Mrs. Gable’s lap, curled into a tight ball, and began to purr. It wasn't a loud, insistent purr, but a soft, steady hum that spoke of shared presence and unwavering affection. She kneaded gently with her paws, a gesture of deep trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gable slowly reached down, stroking Luna's sleek back. The loneliness didn't vanish entirely, but it receded, replaced by a quiet warmth, a gentle comfort. In the soft purr of a once-feral cat, she found a silent promise of companionship, a bond forged not with words, but with shared moments, quiet understanding, and the simple, profound act of being there for one another. Luna, the shadow cat, had found her light, and in doing so, had illuminated Mrs. Gable's world. Their friendship, as simple and true as the rising sun, was now an inseparable part of both their lives.\n"

      "Luna was a creature of quiet habits and even quieter purrs. Her fur, the color of twilight, absorbed the morning sun and melted into the evening shadows. Her days revolved around sunbeams, the precise moment breakfast appeared, and the rhythmic sound of Mrs. Gable's knitting needles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gable was Luna’s human, a woman whose hands were gnarled with age but whose touch was always feather-light and infinitely gentle. Their friendship wasn't one of boisterous games or loud declarations. It was built on shared silence, on the warmth of a lap, and the unspoken understanding that bloomed between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One crisp autumn afternoon, a chill had seeped into the old house, and a deeper chill seemed to have settled into Mrs. Gable's spirit. She sat in her armchair by the window, not knitting, not reading, just gazing out at the rustling, falling leaves. Her shoulders were hunched, and a sigh, barely audible, escaped her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luna, who had been curled into a tight, black knot on the worn Persian rug, stretched languidly. Her green eyes, usually half-lidded in sleepy contentment, fixed on Mrs. Gable. She didn't understand human sadness, but she understood the shift in the air, the quiet gravity that had replaced the usual gentle hum of their home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly, deliberately, Luna rose. She padded across the room, her steps silent as mist. She rubbed against Mrs. Gable's slippered foot, a soft *mrrrp* escaping her throat. Mrs. Gable didn't stir immediately. Luna tried again, a more insistent head-butt against her knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Mrs. Gable's gaze drifted down. A faint smile, fragile as old lace, touched her lips. \"Hello, my shadow,\" she whispered, her voice a little reedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luna, sensing the small opening, made a graceful leap. She landed softly on Mrs. Gable's lap, curling into a familiar, comforting ball. Then, with a deep breath that ruffled her soft fur, she began to purr. It started as a low rumble, deep in her chest, a tiny engine of warmth and reassurance. It grew steadily, vibrating through Mrs. Gable's old bones, through the fabric of her worn cardigan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gable's hand, hesitant at first, slowly reached out and began to stroke Luna's sleek back. The rhythmic petting, combined with the continuous, rumbling purr, was a balm. The tension in Mrs. Gable's shoulders eased. The fragile smile widened just a fraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat like that for a long time, the only sounds the soft hum of the cat and the gentle rustle of leaves outside. No words were exchanged, none were needed. In the quiet presence of her feline friend, Mrs. Gable found a quiet solace, a reminder that even in stillness, she was not alone. And Luna, with her steadfast warmth and unwavering purr, knew she had done her most important job: being there. Their friendship, a tapestry woven from silent moments, was the strongest thread in their lives.\n"
